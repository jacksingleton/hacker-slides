# Hacker Slides

### Hack together simple slides

---

## The Basics

- Separate slides using '`---`' on a blank line
- Write github flavored markdown
- Click 'Present' (top right) when you're ready to talk

---

## Quick tips

- There is also a speaker view, with notes - press '`s`'
- Press '`?`' with focus on the presentation for shortcuts
- <em>You can use html when necessary</em>
- Share the 'Present' URL with anyone you like!
- Swap '`---`' for '`--`' if you want your slides to move vertically rather than horizontally
- You can use a combination of '`--`' and `'---`' to add more structure to your presentation

Note:
- Anything after `Note:` will only appear here
