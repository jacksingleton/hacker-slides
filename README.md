# Sandstorm Hacker Slides

This is a simple app that combines [Ace Editor](https://github.com/ajaxorg/ace/) and [RevealJS](https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js)

You can write markdown on the left, and preview your presentation on the right.

Currently just a prototype - but it is functional. See [hacker-slides.otl](hacker-slides.otl) for my notes and TODO's
